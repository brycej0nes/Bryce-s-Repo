### Data and Viz of Interest

Upon initial exploration of data and types of visualizations, I found myself to be most interested in this article (link below)
https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/06/15/most-black-americans-believe-u-s-institutions-were-designed-to-hold-black-people-back/

This article caught my interest because it really resonates with my experience as a young black man who also actively participates in and feels strongly about social activisim. By gathering data that directly expresses what a marginalized group thinks or feels about a certain toppic, insights can be gained as to enhance advocacy.

I would love to learn how to creat a bar chart like this using Python. I don't know how to make any data visualizations using Python so I think this would be a great starting point for me since it seems fairly easy from an outsider perspective.

### Ideas for Data to Investigate

In order to find a dataset I might be interested in actually exploring for my project, I provided some topics that I'm interested in below.

**Topics of Interest:**
* Race & Ethnicity
* Intersection between Gender and Sexuality
* Mass Media

Here's a list of research articles that relate to the topics above: 
1. https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/06/cultural-issues-and-the-2024-election/
2. https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/02/22/race-and-lgbtq-issues-in-k-12-schools/
3. https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/06/12/how-americans-get-news-on-tiktok-x-facebook-and-instagram/

### Ideas from Curated Datasets & Project Lists

Dataset | Description | Link
-----|-----|-----|
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175| Consists of healthcare statistics and categorical data about patients who have been diagnosed with AIDS. Coding might be helpful in seeing if there are any social or biological factors that come into play (e.g. race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/890/aids+clinical+trials+group+study+175
-----|-----|-----|
Drug Consumption (Quantified) | Consists of categorical and quantified data exemplifying respondents' personality and any identifying factors in addition to their drug consumption habits. Coding might be helpful to help investigate whether there are certain drugs that have more drastic effects on one personality/identity than another | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified
