Welcome to my repository, where the entirety of my progress on the DGT HUM 140 final project will be available to see. The contents of this repository will help guide you in my thought process as I complete my data exploration, visualization, and analysis of humanities topics. Below, I've done some exploratory searching of different visualizations and datasets. 

### Data and Viz of Interest

Upon initial exploration of data and types of visualizations, I found myself to be most interested in this article (link below)
https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/06/15/most-black-americans-believe-u-s-institutions-were-designed-to-hold-black-people-back/

This caught my interest because it really resonates with my experience as a young black man who also actively participates in and feels strongly about social activisim. By gathering data that directly expresses what a marginalized group thinks or feels about a certain toppic, insights can be gained as to enhance advocacy. This directly relates to my interests as a sociology major.

By the end of this course, my goal was to learn how to create bar charts using Python, similarly to this. Before starting, I had no experience with data visualization in Python, so this was an excellent starting point for me. From an outsiderâ€™s perspective, bar graphs seem like they'd be easy to create, rendering it an ideal introduction.

### Ideas for Data to Investigate

After exploring the article provided above, I considered some topics of interest in order to narrow down my search.

**Topics of Interest:**
* Race & Ethnicity
* Intersection between Gender and Sexuality
* Mass Media

Here's a list of research articles that relate to the topics above: 
1. https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/06/cultural-issues-and-the-2024-election/
2. https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/02/22/race-and-lgbtq-issues-in-k-12-schools/
3. https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/06/12/how-americans-get-news-on-tiktok-x-facebook-and-instagram/

### Ideas from Curated Datasets & Project Lists


Dataset | Description | Link
-----|-----|-----|
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 175| Consists of healthcare statistics and categorical data about patients who have been diagnosed with AIDS. Coding might be helpful in seeing if there are any social or biological factors that come into play (e.g. race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/890/aids+clinical+trials+group+study+175
-----|-----|-----|
Drug Consumption (Quantified) | Consists of categorical and quantified data exemplifying respondents' personality and any identifying factors in addition to their drug consumption habits. Coding might be helpful to help investigate whether there are certain drugs that have more drastic effects on one personality/identity than another | https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified
